ToDoList - Great
================

## What's it about
This is an todo-list application that we developed in the year 2011(Sept ~ Nov).
It came out originally as a school project.

While I feel the "smart add" feature is pretty nice, I'm thinking to take this
project out, and see how to improve from there.

## How to build / run

To Build the project: 

    gradle build

To run it:

    gradle run

## TODOs
[ ] Global Shortcut key
[ ] `cmd + Q` with a 'Save Changes?' prompt; or at least, autosave
[ ] SubTask, with infinite levels
[ ] Context / Project -- Borrow these ideas from OmniFocus.
